# # Cat-culator

Welcome to this mini project made with Stencil and a lot of love!💖

This is a magic calculator that returns images of kittens!😻

It is ideal for children who are learning to calculate, as they can see the quantities reflected in the cats, and do the addition➕, subtraction➖, division➗ and multiplication✖ operations with the help of the pictures. 

The result is that maths becomes more dynamic and interactive through 'visual thinking'.

## How it works!

The way it works is very simple. All you have to do is clicking on a number on the calculator, that number will appear on the screen, of course. 
But, pay attention, the same number of kittens will also appear right next to the calculator.👉

Then you have to choose the operator (➕, ➖, ➗ and ✖) and it will also appear on the screen. 

Choose the number you need to do the operation, and the kittens indicated by this number will appear again. 

👧Children can do the operation with the help of the images. It is the same as using their little hands🖐, which help them so much when learning to calculate, but this time, they will receive the help of our friends: 🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈

## Stencil App Starter

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all. In many cases, Stencil can be used as a drop in replacement for traditional frontend frameworks given the capabilities now available in the browser, though using it as such is certainly not required.

Stencil also enables a number of key capabilities on top of Web Components, in particular Server Side Rendering (SSR) without the need to run a headless browser, pre-rendering, and objects-as-properties (instead of just strings).
